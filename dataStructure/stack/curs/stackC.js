! 	Stack
?		1. The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of
?				 Last In First Out (LIFO) 
?		2.	A stack of plates. The last plate placed on the top of the stack is also the first plate removed
?				from the stack.
?		3.	Stack is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model

?		4.	The Stack data structure supports two main operations
?				- Push, which adds an element to the collection
?				- Pop, which removes the most recently added element from the collection
