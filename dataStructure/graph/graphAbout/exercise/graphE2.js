?		1.	What is a graph?
?			Is a non linear data structure which has vertices/nodes connected with edges
?			Tree is a specific type of graph

?		2.	Types of graph
?			-	directed  
?			- undirected  

? 	3.	Directed 
?					- graph has one direction
?					- represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed

?				Undirected
?					- a graph in which the edges has bidirectional
?					- can be traversed in either direction
?					- the absence of the arrow tells us that graph is undirected

? 	4. Explain all types of graph
? 			vertices(nodes) - without edges
? 			vertices(nodes) -	cycles
? 			vertices(nodes) -	multiple edges from one node
? 			vertices(nodes) -	self loops on a node
? 			vertices(nodes) -	disconnected
? 			vertices(nodes) -	contains wight on edges representing the cost of traversing

?		5.	graph usage
?				google maps(cities are vertices/nodes and roads are edges to build a nav system)
?				social media sites (users are vertices/nodes and links are edges)

? 1.	What is a graph?
?		Graph is a non linear data structure which contains fine numbers of vertices/nodes connected by edges
?		Tree is a specific of a graph

? 2.	Types of graph
?			- directed
?			-	undirected

? 3.	Directed
?			-	vertices have one direction and the arrows is pointing into the direction of the node

? 		Undirected
?			-	can be traversed in both direction
?			-	the absence of the arrows tells that graph is undirected/bidirectional
