! What is a graph?

? A Graph is non linear data structure that consists of a fine number of vertex(nodes) connected by edges
? Trees are specific type of graph data structure


! Types of graph

? 	- Directed
?		-	Undirected

! 	Directed Graph
? 	A graph in one direction is considerate directed graph
? 	Edges are usually represented by arrow pointing 

! Undirected Graph

?	A Graph in which the edges are bidirectional
? 	The graph can be traversed in either direction 
?	The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is unidirectional


! More graph types 

? -	vertex(node) -  without edges (there are not connected)
? -	vertex(node) -  multiple edges from one to many 
? -	vertex(node) -  cycles
? -	vertex(node) -	self loops on a node
? -	vertex(node) -	disconnected
? -	vertex(node) -	contains weight on edges representing the cost of traversing

! 	Graph Usage

?		-	Google maps ( cities are nodes/vertices and roads are edges to build a nav system)
?		- Social media sites ( users are node/vertices and links are edges)
