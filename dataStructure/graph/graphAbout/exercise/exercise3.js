/*

! 	Graph
?		Is a non linear data structure that consists of a fine number of node(vertices) connected by edges


! 	Types of Graph
?		- Directed
?		- Undirected

! 	Direct Graph
?		A Graph in which the edges a direction
?		Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed 


! 	Undirected Graph
?		A Graph in which the edges are bidirectional
?		The graph can be traversed in either direction
?		The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected


! More graph types

?		-	vertices(nodes) without edges
?		-	vertices(nodes) multiple edges from one node
?		-	vertices(nodes) cycles
?		-	vertices(nodes) self loops on a node
?		-	vertices(nodes) disconnected
?		-	vertices(nodes) contains weight on edges representing the cost of traversing

! Graph Usage

?		-	Google maps(cities are nodes/vertices and roads are edges to build a nav system)
?		-	Social media sites ( users are node/vertices and links are edges)
