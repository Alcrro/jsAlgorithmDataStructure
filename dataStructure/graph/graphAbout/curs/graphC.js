/*
! 	Graph
? 1.	A graph is non linear data structure that consists of a fine number of vertices(nodes) connected by edges.
?	2.	Trees are specific type of graph data structure
*/

/*
! 	Types of Graph
? 		-	Directed
?			-	Undirected
*/

/*
! Directed Graph
? 	A Graph in which the edges have a direction
?		Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed
*/

/*
! Undirected Graph
? 	A Graph in which the edges are bidirectional
?		The graph can be traversed in either direction
? 	The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected
*/

/*
! More graph types 
? 	- vertices(nodes) without edges
? 	- vertices(nodes) multiple edges from one node
? 	- vertices(nodes) cycles 
? 	- vertices(nodes) self loops on a node 
? 	- vertices(nodes) disconnected
? 	- vertices(nodes) contains weight on edges representing the cost of traversing
*/

/*
! 	Graph Usage

?		-	Google maps ( cities are nodes/vertices and roads are edges to build a nav system)
?		- Social media sites ( users are node/vertices and links are edges)
